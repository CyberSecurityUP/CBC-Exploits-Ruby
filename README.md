# CBC-Exploits-Ruby

CBC-MAC is a method to ensure integrity of a message by encrypting it using CBC mode and keeping the last encrypted block as "signature". This ensures that a malicious user can not modify any part of the data without having to change the signature. The key used for the "encryption" ensures that the signature can't be guessed.

However, when using CBC-MAC, the developer needs to be very careful if the message are not of fixed length. In this example, we will use the fact that there is no protection in place to get the application to sign two messages and build another message by concatenating the two messages.

With CBC-MAC, we can generate two signatures t and t' for the messages m and m'. By using m and m' we can forge another message m'' that will have the same signature as m' (t'). One thing to keep in mind is that the recommended way to use CBC-MAC is to use a NULL IV.

To keep things simple, we are going to work on a single block for each message.

We can see below how signing both messages works (NB: both signatures are completely independent of each other):

If we try to concatenate those messages, the signature is no longer valid (since t is now the IV for the second block where it was only NULL before):

However, if we XOR m' and t, the signature is now t':
